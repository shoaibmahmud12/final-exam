            Grill the salmon on a preheated grill for about 4-5 minutes per side or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.
            Serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon and a side of grilled vegetables.
            Baked Lemon Garlic Salmon:
            
            Place salmon fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

            Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 12-15 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through.
            Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
            Pan-Seared Salmon:
            
            Season salmon fillets with salt, pepper, and a pinch of paprika.
            Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with olive oil.
            Sear the salmon fillets skin-side down first for about 3-4 minutes, then flip and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
            Serve with a squeeze of lemon.
            Salmon Ceviche:

            Make a teriyaki sauce using soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, and ginger.
            Marinate salmon in the teriyaki sauce for at least 30 minutes.
            Grill or broil the salmon until it's caramelized and cooked to your liking.
            Serve over rice and drizzle with additional teriyaki sauce.
            Poached Salmon with Dill Sauce:
            
            Poach salmon fillets in a mixture of white wine, water, lemon slices, and fresh dill.
            While the salmon is poaching, prepare a dill sauce using mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, chopped fresh dill, and lemon juice.
